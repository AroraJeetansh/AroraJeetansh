***Backend Developer***

How’s it going? Hope you’re doing well.  
I’m **Jeetansh Arora**, a backend developer who enjoys working on server-side logic, APIs, and databases. I mostly build things to learn, break them, and understand how real backend systems work.

Most of the projects here are built for **learning and experimentation**. They’re not meant to be revolutionary, but each one helps me understand backend architecture, data flow, authentication, and system design better.

If you ever feel like talking about backend development, systems, or tech in general, feel free to reach out.
