How’s it going? Hope you’re doing well.
I’m Jeetansh Arora, a backend developer who enjoys working on server-side logic, APIs, and databases. I mostly build things to learn, break them, and understand how real backend systems work.

Most of my projects aren’t meant to be groundbreaking. They’re learning-focused and built to strengthen fundamentals around backend architecture, data handling, and API design.

If you ever feel like talking about backend, systems, or tech in general, feel free to reach out.
